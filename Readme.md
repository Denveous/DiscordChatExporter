**DiscordChatExporter** is an application that can be used to export message history from any [Discord](https://discord.com) channel to a file.
It works with direct messages, group messages, and server channels, and supports Discord's dialect of markdown as well as most other rich media features.

> **Important**:
> To launch the GUI version of the app on MacOS, you need to first remove the downloaded file from quarantine.
> You can do that by running the following command in the terminal: `xattr -rd com.apple.quarantine DiscordChatExporter.app`.
